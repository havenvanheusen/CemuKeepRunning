# CemuKeepRunning

This program was inspired by the batch script written by CasperH2O on this reddit thread: 

https://www.reddit.com/r/cemu/comments/6clcun/cemu_bat_help/

It is a simple Visual Basic program written to restart Cemu in the event of it crashing. It has additional options
that enable a second program (with arguments) to be run in tandem with cemu.exe.

This is one of my first projects that have been published, so be gentle.
